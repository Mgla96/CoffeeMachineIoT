### About
This is an automated IoT Coffee Machine I am building that is controlled by a Raspberry pi. When it is activated through a Siri Voice command such as "make coffee", it gathers Twitter activity from the past 24 hours from people tagging my account using the hashtags #darkroast, #mediumroast, or #lightroast and makes coffee with the roast that is voted on the most.

Siri is implemented through SiriControl an open source framework created by Sanjeet Chatterjee.
