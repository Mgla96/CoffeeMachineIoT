### About
This is an automated IoT Coffee Machine I am building that is controlled by a Raspberry Pi. When it is activated through a Siri Voice command such as "make coffee", it gathers Twitter activity from the past 24 hours from people tagging my account using the hashtags #darkroast, #mediumroast, or #lightroast and makes coffee with the roast of coffee bean that is voted on the most in the past 24 hours.

Siri is implemented through SiriControl an open source framework created by Sanjeet Chatterjee.
